The program should determine and output the type(s) of triangle based on the following criteria:\n- Equilateral: All three sides have equal lengths.\n- Isosceles: Two sides have equal lengths, and the third side has a different length.\n- Scalene: All three sides have different lengths.\n- Right: The triangle forms a 90-degree angle at one corner." },
